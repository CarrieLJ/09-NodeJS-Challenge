# Creating a README

  ![github license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)

  ## Description:

  This project was created to apply my newly learned skills of using Node JS. This application will also be a quick and easy way for me to populate my own README for other projects I work on. I learned how to include packages, create user inputs into the terminal, how to create and apply a badge, how to create a table of contents in the README.md, and continually learn about functions.

## Installation:

  To use the product navigate to my GitHub webpage at: https://github.com/CarrieLJ/09-NodeJS-Challenge

## Usage: 

  To use, open the code and enter “node index.js” to initiate the questions for input on the README.md. ![1_initiate_questions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114967552/209863755-758eebcd-dd93-41c2-843e-1a1ba1e1799a.JPG) Answer the questions by typing in your answers. Except for the license question. That one you will hit enter on the highlighted one you want to use. ![2_selecting_license](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114967552/209863762-e2312ed7-117b-4e01-9651-bd70fc8336d5.JPG) You can add images by providing links. I create an Issue within my GitHub project, save the pictures I want to add, and copy and paste the link that is created into the terminal where I want the pictures to be in the README.md. ![issue_for_snips](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114967552/209863907-29b42ce6-ea11-4b4d-9065-9834a0da6d1a.JPG) Once questions are all answered, the README.md file is created and ready for you to apply to your project. ![3_readme_file_created](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114967552/209863765-f18eed68-430e-488a-8289-286f91947e91.JPG) ![4_open_preview_readme](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114967552/209863768-bf93cf40-3f85-4c0b-b1c7-c1481677269b.JPG) ![5_readme_preview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114967552/209863773-0f06b9aa-909b-498a-80c9-eaf0db4568ca.JPG)
